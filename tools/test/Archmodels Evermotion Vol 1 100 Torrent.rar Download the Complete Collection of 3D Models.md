But what is Silent Hunter 5 like as a game? Is it worth playing despite its flaws and frustrations? The answer depends on how much you enjoy submarine simulations and how patient you are with technical issues. Silent Hunter 5 is not a game for casual players or newcomers to the genre. It is a complex and demanding simulation that requires a lot of time, attention, and dedication to master. You will have to deal with realistic aspects of submarine warfare, such as fuel consumption, battery power, oxygen levels, sonar detection, torpedo reloading, damage control, and more. You will also have to learn how to use various tools and instruments, such as the periscope, the TDC (torpedo data computer), the hydrophone, the map screen, and the recognition manual.
 
Some of these features are well implemented and add to the immersion and challenge of the game. For instance, the periscope is a joy to use, allowing you to zoom in and out, adjust the focus, measure the distance and angle of enemy ships, and even take photos for intelligence purposes. The TDC is also a useful device that helps you calculate the speed, course, and range of your targets and set up your torpedo solutions. The map screen is another essential tool that lets you plot your course, set waypoints, mark contacts, view weather conditions, and access radio messages.

However, some features are poorly designed or executed and detract from the enjoyment of the game. For example, the new crew management system is cumbersome and tedious. Instead of using a simple interface to assign crew members to different stations and tasks, you have to walk around the sub in first-person view and talk to them individually. This might sound realistic and immersive, but it's actually annoying and time-consuming. You have to deal with loading screens every time you move between compartments, awkward camera angles and animations when interacting with crew members, and repetitive voice acting and dialogue options. Moreover, the crew morale system is broken and unrealistic. Your crew members will lose morale for trivial reasons, such as being ordered to man the deck gun or being denied shore leave. They will also gain morale for absurd reasons, such as being given chocolate or cigarettes. The morale system has no noticeable effect on the performance or behavior of your crew members anyway.
 
Another feature that is poorly implemented is the dynamic campaign. While it sounds promising on paper, it fails to deliver a coherent and engaging story of the war. The campaign consists of several chapters that span from 1939 to 1943 (the last two years of the war are not included), each with a main objective and several optional objectives that vary depending on your location and date. However, these objectives are vague and repetitive, often requiring you to sink a certain number or type of ships in a specific area or patrol zone. There is no clear connection or progression between them, nor any sense of historical context or significance. The campaign also suffers from bugs and glitches that prevent you from completing some objectives or trigger them at inappropriate times.
 
The game also has many technical problems that affect its stability and performance. The graphics are decent but not impressive, especially when compared to other recent games in the genre. The water effects are realistic and dynamic, but the ship models are bland and lack detail. The sound effects are good but not varied enough, especially when it comes to explosions and gunfire. The music is atmospheric but repetitive and sometimes out of place. The game also suffers from frequent crashes, freezes, slowdowns, graphical glitches, sound glitches, interface glitches, AI glitches, and more. Some of these issues can be fixed by applying patches or mods (the game has a very active modding community), but others remain unresolved.
