# Wanted 2: A Sequel That Never Happened
 
Wanted, released in 2008, was a stylish and thrilling action movie based on a comic book series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones. It starred James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson, a bored office worker who discovers he is the son of a legendary assassin and joins a secret society of killers called the Fraternity. Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, and Terence Stamp co-starred as his mentors and allies.
 
The movie was a box office hit, grossing over $340 million worldwide on a budget of $75 million. It also received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its visual effects, stunts, and performances. Many fans were eager to see a sequel that would continue Wesley's story and explore more of the Fraternity's history and secrets.

However, despite several attempts by the filmmakers and the actors to develop a follow-up, Wanted 2 never materialized. The main reason was the difficulty of finding a compelling story that would justify bringing back Jolie's character Fox, who died at the end of the first movie. Jolie was considered essential for the sequel's success, as she was the most popular and recognizable star of the franchise.
 
Several scripts were written by different writers, but none of them satisfied Jolie or the studio. Some of them involved resurrecting Fox through various means, such as cloning, time travel, or alternate realities. Others focused on introducing new characters or expanding the Fraternity's mythology. But none of them captured the original's tone and spirit.
 
Eventually, Jolie dropped out of the project in 2010, citing her lack of interest in reprising her role. McAvoy and Freeman also expressed their doubts about returning without her. The director of the first movie, Timur Bekmambetov, moved on to other projects, such as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Ben-Hur. The rights to the comic book series reverted back to Millar in 2012.
 
Since then, there have been no official updates on Wanted 2. Some rumors suggested that it could be rebooted as a TV series or a video game, but nothing has been confirmed. It seems that Wanted 2 is one of those sequels that will remain in development hell forever.
 
However, fans of Wanted can still enjoy the original movie in high definition on various streaming platforms and digital stores. The movie is available in 720p resolution, which offers a clear and crisp picture quality that enhances its stunning visuals and action scenes. Wanted is also compatible with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, which creates an immersive audio experience that makes you feel like you are part of the Fraternity.
 
If you are looking for a fast-paced and fun action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, you can't go wrong with Wanted. And who knows, maybe one day we will get to see Wanted 2 in 720p as well.

Wanted was based on a comic book series of the same name by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, published by Top Cow Productions. However, the movie made significant changes to the source material, such as replacing the supervillains with assassins, removing the superhero elements, and altering the characters' personalities and motivations. Millar and Jones were involved in the movie's production and gave their approval to the changes.
 
The movie featured several impressive action sequences that showcased the Fraternity's ability to bend the laws of physics and manipulate bullets. The most famous scene was the "car flip" stunt, in which Wesley jumps out of his car and shoots his pursuers while in mid-air. The stunt was performed by a real stuntman using wires and a hydraulic ramp. The car was later added digitally.
 
The movie also had a star-studded cast that included Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, and Konstantin Khabenskiy. Jolie played Fox, Wesley's mentor and love interest, who had a tattoo of a fox on her neck. McAvoy played Wesley, a timid and unhappy office worker who transforms into a confident and skilled assassin. Freeman played Sloan, the leader of the Fraternity who has a hidden agenda.
 
Wanted was directed by Timur Bekmambetov, a Russian-Kazakh filmmaker who was known for his fantasy and sci-fi movies, such as Night Watch (2004) and Day Watch (2006). He brought his distinctive visual style and flair to Wanted, creating a dark and gritty world with a touch of humor and surrealism. He also used a technique called "bullet time", which slows down the action to show the trajectory of bullets.
 
Wanted was released on June 27, 2008 in the United States and on June 25, 2008 in the United Kingdom. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its action scenes, visual effects, performances, and direction. It also performed well at the box office, earning over $341 million worldwide on a budget of $75 million. It was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.
