Some of the examples of supplications from Al Adhkar are:

1. After every prayer, it is recommended to recite three times: "I seek the forgiveness from Allah" (Astaghfiru Allah), followed by a supplication for peace, majesty, and generosity of Allah[^1^].
2. After completing the prayer, it is also recommended to recite a supplication that affirms the oneness and greatness of Allah, His dominion and praise, His power and might, His blessings and virtue, and His exclusive right to be worshipped[^1^].
3. Another supplication after the prayer is to recite 33 times each: "Glory be to Allah" (Subhan Allah), "All praise is due to Allah" (Al-Hamdulillah), and "Allah is the greatest" (Allahu Akbar), and then complete the hundredth supplication by saying: "There is no god but Allah alone without any partners. To Him belongs the dominion and the praise, and He has power over all things" (La ilaha illa Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahul mulk wa lahul hamd wa huwa âala kulli shayin qadeer)[^1^].
4. In the morning and evening, it is recommended to recite a supplication that declares the perfection and uniqueness of Allah, His everlastingness and self-sufficiency, His knowledge and power, His ownership and control over everything in the heavens and earth, and His incomparable greatness[^2^]. This supplication is known as Ayat al-Kursi (the Verse of the Throne) and it is one of the most important verses in the Quran.
5. Another supplication for the morning and evening is to ask Allah for wellness in one's body, hearing, and seeing[^2^]. This supplication shows one's dependence on Allah for physical health and well-being.
6. There are also many other supplications for various occasions and situations in Al Adhkar, such as before sleeping, upon waking up, before eating, after eating, when entering or leaving the house, when traveling or returning from a journey, when visiting the sick or attending a funeral, when seeking protection from evil or harm, when asking for forgiveness or guidance, when expressing gratitude or praise, and many more[^3^] [^4^].
