Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a popular first-person shooter game that features a variety of modes and maps. One of the skills that can give you an edge over your enemies is strafe jumping, which is a technique that allows you to move faster and farther by combining sprinting, jumping, and turning in mid-air.
 
Strafe jumping can be difficult to master, especially if you are not used to the game's physics and controls. However, there is a way to make it easier by using a script that automates the process for you. A script is a set of commands that you can bind to a key on your keyboard or mouse that will execute them when you press it.

In this article, we will show you how to use a strafe jump script for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare that works on both cracked and original versions of the game. We will also explain how it works and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using it.
  
## What is a Strafe Jump Script?
 
A strafe jump script is a config script that you can add to your game folder that will perform a series of actions when you press a certain key. The script will adjust your yaw speed, which is how fast you can turn left or right, and execute a sequence of movements that will make you strafe jump automatically.
 
The script we will use in this article is based on the one posted by jamieXD2 on GameBanana[^1^], which is one of the most popular strafe jump scripts for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The script has two parts: one for launching the jump and one for landing it. Here is what the script looks like:

/seta strafe1 "cl_yawspeed 270;+forward;+attack;-attack;+sprint;wait 42;+moveleft;+left;wait 30;cl_yawspeed 271;wait 55;+gostand;-gostand;vstr strafe2"
/seta strafe2 "wait 23;cl_yawspeed 7;wait 200;-left;-forward;-sprint;-moveleft; cl_yawspeed 140"
bind q "vstr strafe1"
`  
The first line sets the variable strafe1 to a string of commands that will do the following:
 
- Set your yaw speed to 270, which is higher than the default value of 140.
- Move forward and fire your weapon once.
- Sprint and wait for 42 milliseconds.
- Move left and turn left at the same time.
- Wait for 30 milliseconds.
- Set your yaw speed to 271, which is slightly higher than before.
- Wait for 55 milliseconds.
- Stand up and crouch down quickly.
- Execute the variable strafe2.

The second line sets the variable strafe2 to another string of commands that will do the following:

- Wait for 23 milliseconds.
- Set your yaw speed to 7, which is very low.
- Wait for 200 milliseconds.
- Stop moving and turning left.
- Set your yaw speed back to 140, which is the default value.

The third line binds the key q to execute the variable strafe1, which will start the whole process. You can change this key to whatever you prefer, as long as it does not conflict with any other function in the game.
  
## How to Use a Strafe Jump Script?
