## How to acquire data from different devices and sources using EnCase Forensic V7?
 
The first step in any digital investigation is to acquire data from the devices or sources that may contain relevant evidence. EnCase Forensic V7 provides various methods to acquire data in a forensically sound manner, meaning that the original data is not altered or damaged during the acquisition process.
 
Some of the methods to acquire data using EnCase Forensic V7 are:

- Physical acquisition: This method involves creating a bit-by-bit copy of the entire physical storage device, such as a hard drive or a memory card. This method preserves all the data on the device, including deleted or hidden files, slack space, unallocated space, and file system metadata. Physical acquisition can be done using software write blocking protection (by FastBlock SE), which prevents any changes to the original device during the acquisition process.
- Logical acquisition: This method involves creating a copy of the logical files and folders on the device, such as documents, pictures, videos, etc. This method only captures the data that is visible to the operating system and does not include deleted or hidden files. Logical acquisition can be done using Virtual File System (VFS), which allows access to files and folders on remote devices over a network connection.
- Cloud acquisition: This method involves collecting data from cloud-based applications or services, such as email accounts, social media accounts, online storage accounts, etc. This method requires valid credentials or tokens to access 8cf37b1e13
