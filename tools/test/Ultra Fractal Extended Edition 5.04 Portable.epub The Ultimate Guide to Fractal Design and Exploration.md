The first example is a Mandelbrot set with a spiral coloring algorithm. The Mandelbrot set is one of the most famous and iconic fractals, and it is generated by iterating a simple formula: z = z^2 + c, where z and c are complex numbers. The spiral coloring algorithm assigns a color to each point based on the angle of its orbit around the origin. The result is a stunning image that reveals the intricate structure of the Mandelbrot set.

The second example is a Julia set with a smooth coloring algorithm. The Julia set is another classic fractal that is closely related to the Mandelbrot set. It is generated by iterating the same formula as the Mandelbrot set, but with a fixed value of c for each point. The smooth coloring algorithm assigns a color to each point based on the number of iterations it takes to escape a certain radius. The result is a smooth gradient that highlights the shape of the Julia set.

The third example is a Newton set with a rainbow coloring algorithm. The Newton set is a fractal that is generated by applying Newton's method to find the roots of a polynomial equation. The rainbow coloring algorithm assigns a color to each point based on the root it converges to and the number of iterations it takes to converge. The result is a colorful image that shows the different basins of attraction of the Newton set.
