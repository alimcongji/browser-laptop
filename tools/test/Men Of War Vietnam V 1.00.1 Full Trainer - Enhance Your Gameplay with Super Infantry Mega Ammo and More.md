If you want to make the game easier or more fun, you can use a trainer that modifies certain aspects of the game, such as health, ammo, stamina, fuel, and reinforcement points. A trainer is a program that runs in the background and injects code into the game's memory to alter its behavior. However, using a trainer may cause some issues with the game's stability or compatibility, so use it at your own risk.
 
One of the trainers available for Men Of War Vietnam is made by Cheat Happens[^2^]. It works with both the retail and the Steam versions of the game, but you need to download the correct trainer for your game version. The trainer has several options that you can activate or deactivate by pressing certain keys on your keyboard. Here are the options and their corresponding keys:

If you are wondering whether Men Of War Vietnam is worth playing, you may want to check out some reviews from critics and players. The game has received mixed reactions, with some praising its realism, complexity, and challenge, and others criticizing its difficulty, bugs, and lack of polish.
 
According to GameSpot[^1^], Men Of War Vietnam is "a serious test of your patience and your real-time strategy skills". The reviewer praised the intricate map design and the cooperative option, but found the game too frustrating and unforgiving. He also noted some technical issues, such as poor voice acting, glitches, and crashes. He gave the game a score of 6 out of 10.
 
IGN[^2^] had a similar opinion, calling the game "one of the toughest game's I've played in a very long time". The reviewer liked the realistic combat scenarios and the tactical options, but disliked the steep learning curve, the inconsistent game mechanics, and the lack of polish. He also mentioned some bugs and compatibility problems. He gave the game a score of 5.5 out of 10.
 
TechSpot[^3^] was more positive, saying that "if you've never played a Men of War game before, Vietnam is as good a place to start as any". The reviewer appreciated the depth and variety of the game, but acknowledged that it was not for everyone. He also pointed out some flaws, such as poor graphics, voice acting, and interface. He gave the game a score of 7.4 out of 10.
 
As you can see, Men Of War Vietnam is a game that appeals to a niche audience of hardcore strategy fans who don't mind a lot of challenge and frustration. If you are one of them, you may enjoy this game and its trainer. If not, you may want to look for something else.
