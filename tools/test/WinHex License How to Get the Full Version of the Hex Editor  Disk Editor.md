In this article, we will explain the differences between the license types and help you choose the right one for your needs.
 
## Personal License
 
A personal license is the cheapest option for Winhex. It allows you to use Winhex for personal, non-commercial purposes only. You can install Winhex on one computer and use all the basic features of the hex editor and disk editor. However, you cannot use the scripting and API features, the specialist features (such as support for exFAT, Ext2/3/4, CDFS, UDF file systems), the RAID and dynamic disks features, or the cloning and imaging tool for DOS. You also cannot use Winhex for computer forensics or data recovery services.
