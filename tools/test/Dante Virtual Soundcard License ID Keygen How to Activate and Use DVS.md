But how do you get started with Dante Virtual Soundcard? And how do you activate it with a valid license ID? In this article, we will show you how to obtain, install, and use Dante Virtual Soundcard for professional audio applications.
  
## Obtaining a Dante Virtual Soundcard License ID
 
Before you can use Dante Virtual Soundcard, you need to obtain a valid license ID from Audinate, the company that develops and supports Dante technology. You can purchase a license ID from the Audinate website for $29.99 USD[^1^], or you may receive a free or discounted license ID if you have purchased a Dante-enabled product from one of Audinate's partners[^2^].
 
To obtain a license ID, you need to register with Audinate and provide an email address. You will then receive an email with a link to download the Dante Virtual Soundcard installer and a license ID that you can use to activate the software.
 
Note: Do not confuse the license ID with the serial number of your Dante-enabled product or the DVS token that may come with some products. The license ID is a unique code that looks like this: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. The serial number and the DVS token are not valid for activating Dante Virtual Soundcard. You need to redeem the DVS token on the Audinate website to get a license ID[^3^].
  
## Installing and Activating Dante Virtual Soundcard
 
Once you have downloaded the Dante Virtual Soundcard installer and obtained a license ID, you can install and activate the software on your computer. Follow these steps:
 
1. Run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen.
2. Restart your computer if prompted.
3. Launch the Dante Virtual Soundcard Control Panel from the Start menu or the system tray.
4. Enter your license ID in the Licensing tab and click Activate. Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet during this step.
5. You should see a message that says "Licensed to [your name]" and the software is ready for use.

Note: You can activate your license ID on up to two computers at a time. If you want to use Dante Virtual Soundcard on another computer, you need to deactivate it on one of the computers first by clicking Deactivate in the Licensing tab.
