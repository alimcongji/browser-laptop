## Downloading the Ajax Toolkit 1.1
 
The Ajax Toolkit 1.1 is available as a zip file from the [Ajax Toolkit website](http://www.ajaxtoolkit.net/). You need to unblock the file before extracting it, by right-clicking on it, selecting Properties, and clicking the Unblock button. After extracting the file, you will find the AjaxControlToolkit.dll assembly, which contains all the controls and extenders of the toolkit.
 
## Adding the Ajax Toolkit 1.1 to the Toolbox
 
The easiest way to use the Ajax Toolkit 1.1 is to add it to your Visual Studio toolbox, so that you can drag and drop the controls and extenders onto your web pages. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new ASP.NET Web Forms website or open an existing one.
2. Right-click on the toolbox and select Add Tab. Name the new tab "Ajax Toolkit".
3. Right-click on the new tab and select Choose Items.
4. Browse to the location where you extracted the Ajax Toolkit 1.1 and select the AjaxControlToolkit.dll assembly.
5. Click OK to add all the controls and extenders of the toolkit to your toolbox.

## Using the Ajax Toolkit 1.1 Controls and Extenders
 
The Ajax Toolkit 1.1 contains two types of components: controls and extenders. Controls are standalone elements that provide specific functionality, such as a calendar, a slider, or a rating bar. Extenders are components that attach to existing controls and enhance their behavior, such as adding a confirmation dialog, a watermark text, or a color picker.
 
To use a control or an extender from the toolkit, you need to do two things: add a reference to the AjaxControlToolkit.dll assembly in your web.config file, and add a ScriptManager control to your page. The ScriptManager control enables AJAX functionality on your page and allows you to register scripts and services for your controls and extenders.

After adding these two elements, you can drag and drop any control or extender from the toolbox onto your page. You can then configure its properties using the Properties window or by editing its markup directly. For example, if you want to use the ConfirmButton extender to add a confirmation dialog to a button, you can do something like this:
  ```html <asp:scriptmanager id="ScriptManager1" runat="server"></asp:scriptmanager> <asp:button id="Button1" runat="server" text="Delete"></asp:button> <ajaxtoolkit:confirmbuttonextender id="ConfirmButtonExtender1" runat="server" targetcontrolid="Button1" confirmtext="Are you sure you want to delete this item?"></ajaxtoolkit:confirmbuttonextender> ```  
You can find more information about each control and extender of the toolkit on its [website](http://www.ajaxtoolkit.net/), where you can also see live demos and tutorials.
  
## Conclusion
 
The Ajax Toolkit 1.1 is a useful resource for ASP.NET Web Forms developers who want to create rich and interactive web pages with minimal effort. By downloading and adding the toolkit to your toolbox, you can access more than 30 controls and extenders that enhance your existing controls or provide new functionality.
