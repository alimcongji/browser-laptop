## Step 1: Download the Game and Patches
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the game and patches from a reliable source. You can find many links online, but be careful of malware or viruses. One possible source is [this link](https://bit.ly/QtechSL_Cod4), which contains the game files and patches from version 1.4 to 1.5[^1^]. You will need a torrent client like uTorrent or BitTorrent to download the files.
 
Once you have downloaded the files, extract them to a folder of your choice. You should see a folder called "Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare" with several subfolders inside.
